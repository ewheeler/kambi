Making kambi work is easy!
==========================


1. Install the libsqlite3-ruby package via apt-get
   (this will also install libsqlite3-0 for you)
   TODO: What about OSX? :'(

1b. To use mysql, you have to make the sessions table manually:
    CREATE TABLE `sessions` (`id` int(11) DEFAULT NULL auto_increment PRIMARY KEY, `hashid` varchar(32) DEFAULT NULL, `created_at` datetime DEFAULT NULL, `ivars` text DEFAULT NULL)
   
    Next make a .campingrc file in your home folder:

    host : 127.0.0.1
    port : 3301
    server : mongrel
    database :
      :adapter: mysql
      :database: kambi
      :hostname: localhost
      :username: yourusername
      :password: yourpassword
    log:
      kambi.log

2. Install the following ruby gems:
     * camping
     * reststop
     * activerecord
     * turing
     * htmlentities
	 * RedCloth
   (there are actually more dependancies, but you
   will be prompted by ruby gems to install those)


3. Add the ruby gems bin to your $PATH. I do this by
   adding the following to my .bashrc:

     # add the ruby gems bin to my path
     GEMS_BIN=`ruby -r rubygems -e "print Gem.bindir"`
     PATH="${GEMS_BIN}:${PATH}"


4. Start Kambi by running (in this dir):
     $ camping kambi.rb

5. The top and bottom navigation elements 
   link to pages with nicknames called:
     *about
     *privacy
     *legal
   You will need to either create these pages or
   edit the header and footer links that are 
   hard-coded in the layout method in views.rb

   The help_text method (also in views.rb) links to 
   a page with the nickname:
     *help
   So you may want to make or change this to avoid 
   nasty errors.
