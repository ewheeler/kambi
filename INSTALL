Making kambi work is easy!
==========================


1. Install the libsqlite3-ruby package via apt-get
   (this will also install libsqlite3-0 for you)
   TODO: What about OSX? :'(


2. Install the following ruby gems:
     * camping
     * reststop
     * activerecord
     * turing
     * htmlentities
   (there are actually more dependancies, but you
   will be prompted by ruby gems to install those)


3. Add the ruby gems bin to your $PATH. I do this by
   adding the following to my .bashrc:

     # add the ruby gems bin to my path
     GEMS_BIN=`ruby -r rubygems -e "print Gem.bindir"`
     PATH="${GEMS_BIN}:${PATH}"


4. Start Kambi by running (in this dir):
     $ camping kambi.rb
